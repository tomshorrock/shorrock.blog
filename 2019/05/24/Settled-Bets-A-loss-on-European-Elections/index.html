    <h1>Settled Bets - A loss on European Elections</h1>
    <p>This bet was placed for a very similar reason to my Theresa May leaving by end of June bet. The odds were good, and with the political situation volatile I always look to bet on longshots.</p>
<p>The market’s full name was “Will the UK hold European Election in May 2019?”. You can see with a name like that, all sorts of random things could have happened to make a win, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theresa May gets a deal parliament can agree to</li>
<li>France blocks Brexit extension</li>
<li>EU Elections are delayed a couple of weeks or more for any number of reasons</li>
<li>Any number of unforseeable things that can happen when a political situation is volatile</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, nothing happened so my bets lose. But I absolutely don’t regret it. At such high odds, I think it was worth it. I placed a bet for similar reasons on Theresa May to leave by June. That one happened to win and is gonna win me &pound;2,000.</p>
<p>Here’s my bet (price averaged):<br>
