    <h1>A few quick bets on England v Australia CWC Warm-Up</h1>
    <p><a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19134/game/1173347/england-vs-australia-world-cup-warm-up-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scorecard here</a></p>
<p>I’m going to miss the start of this match but should be around after the first few overs.</p>
<h2 id="12-15-AUS-115-3-23-3"><a href="#12-15-AUS-115-3-23-3" class="headerlink" title="12:15 - AUS 115/3 (23.3)"></a>12:15 - AUS 115/3 (23.3)</h2><p>I’ve only seen a couple of overs, but the bounce seems pretty inconsistent. The batsmen have struggled with balls just short of a good length, which is normally a tell-tale sign of inconsistent bounce. There’s not a lot of seam/swing/spin though.</p>
<p>I don’t fancy Australia’s ability to score quick runs at the end of an innings, so will be betting against runs:<br>

        <td>UNDER 294.5</td>
        <td><strong>&pound;100.00</strong> at <strong>2.00</strong></td>

<h2 id="14-14-AUS-297-9-50"><a href="#14-14-AUS-297-9-50" class="headerlink" title="14:14 - AUS 297/9 (50)"></a>14:14 - AUS 297/9 (50)</h2><p>The bet didn’t work out, although it was close (3 runs). It didn’t deserve to win though, my call on the pitch I think was completely wrong. I don’t think I had seen enough to bet, that’s a mistake I need to learn from. No half-watching, no half-betting anymore.</p>
<p>Normally I’d be looking to bet on England here, I think the pitch is actually a good one. Carey’s innings of 30 from 14 tells me this pitch is good. He’s not good enough to do that on a below-average pitch. I just think Australia never tried to score fast enough. </p>
<p>The problem is England’s odds are <strong>1.43</strong>. I don’t like betting at short odds anyway, plus England’s batting line-up is shorter than usual with no Morgan or Root.</p>
<p>So I’m going to call this a day now, lesson learned not to “half-watch” matches anymore.<br>
